The colour will turn out brightest on light blonde hair and will give a more tonal result on dark hair. Semi permanent dyes coat the outside of the hair rather than developing on it so your base colour will have a big impact on your final result. We recommend always performing a strand test before you do a full application to see how the colour turns out on your hair. <\/p>"

            "question": "DO I NEED TO BLEACH MY HAIR TO USE YOUR PASTEL RANGE OF SEMI PERMANENT DYES?",
            "answer": "<p>Our pastel range delivers the best results on very light blonde hair with no yellow tones. Your base colour will affect how the colour turns out on your hair, so we recommend you always strand test before dyeing your hair to make sure you’re happy with the colour.  If you find from the strand test you need to pre-lighten your hair for the colour to come through how you’d like it, you can use our bleach kit before dyeing. Please wait at least 48–72 hours after bleaching to dye your hair so that the cuticles have time to settle. To eliminate yellow tones from blonde hair before colouring we suggest using a purple shampoo like <a href=\"\/products\/shampoo-color-300ml-10-14floz\" title=\"Shampoo Color\">Brite Shampoo Color Pastel Purple<\/a> or <a href=\"\/products\/toners-300ml-10-14floz\" title=\"Toner Kits\">Brite White Toner<\/a>.<\/p>"

            "question": "Can I mix two semi permanent colours together?",
            "answer": "<p>Absolutely! You can mix two or more of our semi permanent dyes together to make your own personal custom colour.  Just remember that the colour can turn out quite differently on your hair compared to how it looks in the mixing bowl, so please strand test first to check how the colour will turn out on your hair and adjust as necessary before a full application. You can also add white conditioner to semi permanent dyes to lighten the colour. Just be aware that this can make them fade a little faster.<\/p>"

A few applications may be necessary to fully fade the colour. Please patch test this first to ensure you don’t have an adverse reaction.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>Accidents happen, but never fear; if there’s any staining on your surface after cleaning up the initial spill then spraying your normal shower cleaner and leaving overnight will knock out most of the colour staining. If it is safe to use a bleach-based cleaner on the surface this will help to get rid of any staining quickly.<\/p>"

            "question": "I've coloured my hair and found some semi permanent dye on my skin, what do I do?",
            "answer": "<p>To remove any colour from your skin, use hand sanitiser, dish soap or baby oil on a damp cloth to help lift the colour. Alternatively you can mix a bit of baking soda with your regular body wash. (Please patch test these suggestions first to ensure they don't irritate your skin!) <\/p>"

Everyone’s hair is different so the colour will turn out differently on different people. We recommend always performing a strand test on a small, hidden section of your hair before you do a full application. Even if you’ve dyed your hair many times before. If you’re not satisfied with the results of the strand test you can send a photo to <a href=\"mailto:hello@britehair.com\" target=\"_blank\">hello@britehair.com<\/a> and we can help you with some specific advice.<\/p>"
